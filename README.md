# Commitment Manager

A web application designed to help users track and manage open-ended commitmentsâ€”projects, goals, or responsibilities that require regular check-ins but cannot simply be marked "done."

## Overview

Unlike one-off tasks or habits with fixed schedules, commitments often involve multiple sub-items (tasks, habits, notes) and flexible review rhythms. This application helps you stay on top of your long-term commitments by providing structured management and review processes.

## Key Features

- **Commitments Dashboard**: View all active commitments, upcoming reviews, and recent activity
- **Commitment Detail View**:
  - Title & Description
  - Review Frequency (weekly, monthly, custom)
  - Sub-items tracking (tasks, habits)
  - Notes section for progress logs
- **Review Workflow**: Guided flow to review commitments, update sub-items, and log progress
- **Reminders & Notifications**: Alerts for approaching review dates or overdue items
- **Analytics & Progress**: Charts showing review completion, tasks closed, and habit streaks

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React with React Router v7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: Local storage (MVP), MongoDB (future)
- **Backend**: NestJS (planned for post-MVP)
- **Auth**: Auth0 or custom JWT (planned)
